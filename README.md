# Angular Vacation Management App

This project is built using **Angular 18** and is aimed at demonstrating my knowledge and skills as part of my job application process. The app manages employee vacation requests and integrates with an external API for backend functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular 18**: Framework used for building the frontend.
- **Bootstrap 3**: Used for responsive layout and styling.
- **API Integration**: The app communicates with an external API for handling employee data and vacation requests.
- **RxJS**: Used for handling asynchronous operations.
- **LocalStorage**: Used to store session data.

## Features

- **Employee Login**: Admin (HR) users can log in to the system to manage employee vacation requests.
- **Vacation Requests**: Employees can submit vacation requests, and HR can approve or reject them.
